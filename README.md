<h2> Background </h2>

My initial interest in coding began back in 2019 when I started running my own Minecraft server. That experience sparked a deep curiosity, and before beginning my current education, I explored various self-initiated programming challenges — most of them tied to Minecraft in one way or another.
To deepen my skills, I also enrolled in the "Develop Minecraft Plugins" course on Udemy, which gave me hands-on experience with plugin development and Java-based modding.

<h3>Currently</h3>
I'm actively building on the skills I'm learning through my studies. At the moment, I'm focusing on a project that takes up most of my time: a modern website built using C# and the MVC framework. The goal is to create a dynamic and responsive web application that makes API calls to a server delivering real-time statistics for Minecraft players.

<h3>Skills</h3>

🧠 C#

☕ Java

🌐 JavaScript

🗄️ SQL

🧱 HTML

🎨 CSS
