## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h2> Currently studying AP in Computer Science</h2>

Initially, my root of interest came from running a Minecraft server, all the way back in 2019, and since then before my current education, I have dabbled my toes in the high seas of homebrewn coding projects and collaborations.
All of those projects were Minecraft related in some way.

<h3>Currently</h3>
I am practicing my skills from my school.
I've got one project which I am spending quite a bit of time on.
It is an updated website in C# MVC. 
I figured i'd learn how to make a dynamic and responsive website, with API calls to a webserver containing statistics for Minecraft players.
